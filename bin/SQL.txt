SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard programming language used to communicate with and manage data in relational databases.
Why is it used?
SQL is used because it provides a universal, efficient, and powerful way to handle structured data. Nearly every application that stores data in a structured way—from your banking app to social media—uses a database that speaks SQL.

Its main purposes are to perform the four core operations, often called CRUD:
Create: Add new data.
SQL Command: INSERT
Example: Adding a new user to a website's database.

Read: Retrieve data.
SQL Command: SELECT
Example: Finding all customers who live in a specific city.

Update: Modify existing data.
SQL Command: UPDATE
Example: Changing a user's email address.

Delete: Remove data.
SQL Command: DELETE
Example: Removing a product that is no longer for sale.

DATA:
Data is a Raw Fact which describes the properties of an object
Properties is also called as Attributes.

Raw Fact : Without any modification we call it as Original truth or natural truth. EX PANCARD No.

Database: Database is a place where we can store the data iiin a systematic organized manner. In database we are performing operations called CRUD


DBMS : (DataBase Management System)
DBMS is a software which is used to maintain and manage the databse
Features: Security and Authorization
We store data in FILE FORMAT
QUERY Language is used to communicate with DBMS

RDBMS:
A type of software that is used to Maintain Manage Databbse.
Features: Security and Authorization
we store data in the form of TABLE FORMAT.
SQL is used to communicatre with RDBMS

Relational Model:
Any DBMS that follows the Relational Model that'll  be converted into RDBMS.
In Realtional model we store the data in a form of tabular format.

Rules of E.F.CODD:
1. The data Entered into the cell must be single value.
2. Acc. to the rules of E.F.CODD we can give connections for the multiple tables with help of KEY ATTRIBUTES.
3. In RDBMS we store the data in the form of tabulr format which includes meta data.
4. Data can be validate in 2 types:
  I. Data Types
      1. CHAR: Used to store fixed-length text, padding any unused space.

      2. VARCHAR/VARCHAR2: Stores variable-length text, saving space by only using as much as needed.

      3. NUMBER: Used for all kinds of numeric data, including integers and decimals.

      4. DATE: Stores date and time information, such as a specific day or timestamp.

      5. Large Objects (LOBs): These are special types used for storing very large amounts of data.

      Character (CLOB): Used for storing huge blocks of text, like an entire document.

      Binary (BLOB): Used for storing large files like images, videos, or audio clips.

  II. Constraints
    Constraints: These are rules applied to table columns to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data.
